# Codveda Technologies Data Science Internship

This repository contains the tasks completed as part of my Data Science Internship at **Codveda Technologies**.

## Beginner Tasks

Scraped book data from [Books to Scrape](http://books.toscrape.com) using `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and saved results in CSV using `pandas`.

### ✅ Task 2: Data cleaning and preprocessing

Prepared ([Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)) data for analysis and modeling. Handled missing data `(mean, median, mode, drop)`, removed outliers using `IQR method`, `encoded` categorical data and `normalized` numerical columns.
