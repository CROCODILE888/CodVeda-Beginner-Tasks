# Sentiment Classification using Logistic Regression (NLP)

This project focuses on building a sentiment classification model using a custom dataset of short text messages labeled as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.

## 📌 Project Goals
- Preprocess text data (cleaning, stopword removal, stemming)
- Convert text into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF**
- Train a **Logistic Regression** model to classify sentiments
- Evaluate model using **precision**, **recall**, **F1-score**
- Visualize results using a confusion matrix

## 📊 Dataset
A custom CSV file containing short texts and their corresponding sentiment labels.

| Text | Sentiment |
|------|-----------|
| "Enjoying a beautiful day at the park!" | Positive |
| "Traffic was terrible this morning." | Negative |
| "Trying out a new recipe for dinner tonight." | Neutral |

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 🔍 Model Used
- **Logistic Regression** for classification
- TF-IDF for vectorizing text

## 📈 Evaluation
The model was evaluated using the classification report (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) and confusion matrix. It performed with high accuracy on clean, short-form text.


## ✅ Output
Confusion matrix visualization and classification report with high performance on test set.
